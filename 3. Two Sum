Neetcode Array&Hashing 
*********************************
3.Two Sum -- Easy 

Intution:
We have to find sum of two numbers which is equal to a targer we can achive this by Checking each and every number with other , this solution will be taking O(n2) time complexicity.
We have to Use HashMap to solve this problem
We will store elements as key and indexes as their value .

Approach:
We will Itrate through all elements one by one and try find (Target-1st_element=2nd_Emlemets) means if we have one elements we can find onther by subtracting from target 
After subtracting we will find the 2nd elemets in hashmap so 2 cases will happen.

Case 1 : If we Could't find the element in hashMap we will add the elements as key adn their index as value  
         map.put(arr[i],i)

Case 2: If we found that elements in hashmap as key 
        map.ContainsKey(arr[i])
        we will get the key and value and return the current index with value as well as the elements we found inside hashmap

Code:
    class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap();
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(map.containsKey(target-nums[i])){
                result[0]=map.get(target-nums[i]);
                result[1]=i;
                return result;
            }
            else{
                map.put(nums[i],i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;

    }
  }
